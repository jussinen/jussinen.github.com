<p>I'm not one to enjoy talking much about myself.</p>

<p>I'm a web developer currently living in Ipswich, working for the web design agency <a href="http://www.crafted.co.uk">Crafted</a>.</p>

<p>I haven't however always lived in Ipswich, although I knew I was to become a developer from a young age.</p>

<p>I grew up in Geneva and France, despite being english due to my dad taking a position at CERN. It was only when I left home for Leeds Metropolitan University that I actually lived in England.</p>

<p>As a young member of the LDS Church (nicknamed the mormons), I went on a mission in Finland forse two years to share the Gospel and help people. A young man learns a lot in these times and many experiences there have shaped me.</p>

<p>I graduated in Computing after that and started working for Crafted, then named Crafted Media, with some great people. I've learnt a lot in my time here and gained a lot of experience.</p>

<p>I enjoy linguistics, reading, movies as well as sports, especially football which I've played a lot when in France.</p>

<p>I have Crigler-Najjar Syndrome Type 2 and no gallbladder.</p>
