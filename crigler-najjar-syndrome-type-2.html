<blockquote>"You're <s>a wizard, Harry</s> a Crigler-Najjar Syndrome Type 2 sufferer, John"</blockquote>
<p>I had grown up believing the cause of my near-constant jaundice was Gilbert's syndrome, a benign and somewhat common condition.</p>
<p>Before leaving on a mission to Finland, I, like many other missionaries, first went to the <abbr title="Missionary Training Center">MTC</abbr> in Provo, Utah to learn how to teach and the finnish language. Whilst there, my jaundice attracted the attention of medical staff.</p>
<p>After a few tests (which I felt were un-necessary), I was finally taken to a specialist in the area. "You don't have Gilbert's syndrome but Crigler-Najjar Syndrome, type 2" I was told.</p>
<p>My first response was "Type 2? What's the difference with type 1?" to which this helpful doctor explained that a type 1 sufferer requires more treatment and do not live as long or comfortably as a type 2 sufferer as well as other subtle differences.</p>
<p>I'm lucky to be a type 2 sufferer. My heart goes out to those type 1 sufferers as well as anyone who has ever had to live with a genetic condition.</p>
<p>Crigler-Najjar Syndrome Type 2 is a benign condition: I frequently jaundice when I'm tired, hungry, ill or physical and especially so when any of these are combined. This is useful for others who can tell sometimes before I can how tired I am and when I need to go for a rest. I also fatigue faster than others, although it's hard to tell as I've always been like this and don't actually know any different.</p>
<p>Why share this? Well, many in the world suffer more or less to conditions that are very rare. I'm lucky to have a rare condition which is only benign. Others have to live with worse for conditions or diseases that are too rare for much research to have been done.</p>
<p>However we can all share in compassion and sympathy with others who were not as lucky as we have been. Compassion, sympathy share a common root in <em>pathos</em>, meaning suffering. We can all share help someone we know or don't suffer less by sharing their burden.</p>
